					<div>Stephen Aggra was born in Westfield, MA in 1947. In 1955, his 
					family moved to Longmeadow,MA, where his father taught mathematics 
					at the local high school.  Upon graduating from high school in 1965,
					Aggra enrolled as a piano major in the School of Music at Ithaca 
					College in Ithaca, NY. In September of 1967, seeking a less 
					specialized education, he transferred to the newly opened Prescott
					College in Prescott, AZ. A year before, Prescott College had hired
					Fredrick Sommer, renown photographer and long time resident of 
					Prescott, as a coordinator of the Fine Arts Studies.  Sommer was 
					the first person Aggra met at Prescott College and their immediate
					rapport led to a close personal friendship, which was to last until
					Sommer's death in January of 1999.  Their friendship would lead to 
					any number of mutual inspirations and collaborations, the first of 
					which came in April of 1968. Aggra, with a fellow musician, Walt 
					Mendelson, gave the fist public concert of the graphical musical 
					scores Sommer had been drawing since 1934.Seeking to return to his 
					intellectual and creative roots, Aggra left a job as a social worker 
					in New York and moved permanently to Prescott in November 1986. In 
					1989 Aggra began to explore the possibility of making collages from 
					19th Century illustrations and Sommer, always one to master the
					advantages, asked Aggra to cut engraved illustrations from text
					books in anatomy. This made it possible for Sommer to create hundreds
					of collages, and the medium became his principle form of artistic 
					expression throughout the last decade of his life.  During that time
					Aggra continued to make his own collages with Sommer's enthusiastic 
					support and encouragement, and joined in a collaborative partnership
					with photographer Walton Mendelson to produce collagraphs (collages 
					photographed) which were first exhibited at Turner/Krull Gallery in
					1992.  The partnership with Mendelson ended in 2002.Following his 
					graduation from Prescott College in 1969, Aggra returned for an 
					extended visit in the summer of 1971 during which time he 
					collaborated with Sommer in writing The Poetic Logic of Art and 
					Aesthetics. Throughout the next fifteen years, while pursuing 
					interests not related to art or aesthetics, Aggra was often asked
					by Sommer to participate with him in various speaking engagements
					at universities and museums across the United States.Mr. Aggra 
					continues to live in Prescott in a house which Sommer gave him,
					and devotes most of his time to making new collages from old 
					engravings.</div>
