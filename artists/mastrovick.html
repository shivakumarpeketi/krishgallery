					<div>Mastrovick uses cut paper and basic two-dimensional materials
					to create three-dimensional large-scale installations. His language
					becomes a symbolic and visual device, insignificant pieces become 
					the protagonists of his narrative imagery and explosions of color
					are challenged against solid color blocked figures. In Black Bag: An
					American Philosophy of Composition, Mastrovick gives new meaning to
					a common plastic bag by personifying its role in his art and granting
					it a significant story. The bag interacts with characters in his 
					narratives that are using it as a prop, acknowledging it, or engaging
					in a physical relationship with it. In Love Is A Four Letter Word, 
					Mastrovick continues the aesthetic of taking a simple but important 
					idea and making it stand out. With more color, animal and human 
					figures and a setting filled with forestry, the artist proposes
					questions about the idea of love, the different kinds of relationships
					among existing creatures and the ideas of color and emotion. Through 
					his images, love becomes more than just a word; it takes on a 
					visceral quality.</div>
